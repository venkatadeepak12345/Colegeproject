                <strong>About the Department</strong>
                <p>Civil Engineering is a professional engineering discipline that deals with the design, construction, and maintenance of the physical and naturally built environment, including works like roads, bridges, canals, dams, airports, harbors, buildings and ensure that the houses live in are structurally sound as well as improving the lives of people. By continuously developing infrastructures and upgrading the services and facilities to the public, with a sense of responsibility towards humanity for well being of the society. Hence Civil Engineers are backbone and an integral part of society, without them a society could not function. Civil Engineering is s a very diverse profession and offers a wide range of activities across a variety of disciplines such as Surveying, Environmental Engineering, Geotechnical Engineering, Structural Engineering, Transport Engineering Remote Sensing & GIS Applications and Hydraulic Engineering etc . Civil engineering focuses on the application of physical and scientific principles for solving the problems of society, and its history is intricately linked to knowledge of structures, materials science, geography, geology, soil mechanics, hydrology and advance in understanding of physics and mathematics.</p>
