The technologies are related to each other in more ways than one. Data Engineering deals with the collection and preparation of data so that it can be used by Artificial Intelligence in Data Science applications. Data Science utilizes this data and predictively and analyzes it to gain insights. Artificial Intelligence deals with working on data by using tools to develop Intelligent systems. Data Science and Artificial Intelligence work on data to produce similar outcomes dealing with analysis.

This article will give you an overview of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. It will also provide the benefits and types of these 2 methodologies. Moreover, the article compares Data Science and Artificial Intelligence using 3 key factors. Read along to learn more about Artificial Intelligence in Data Science & the relationship between Data Engineering, Data Science, and Artificial Intelligence. It will also specify the role of Artificial intelligence in the fields of Data Science.</p>

             <h2>What is Artificial Intelligence?</h2>
             <p>The ability of digital computers to perform tasks that are commonly performed by humans is called Artificial Intelligence. Modern AI in Field Service solutions demonstrate this capability by automating complex scheduling and maintenance decisions traditionally made by human dispatchers. AI ( Artificial Intelligence ) tries to mimic the human mind by incorporating Problem-Solving, Decision-Making, and Reasoning abilities into machines.

The development in the field of Artificial Intelligence started soon after the development of computers in the 1940s. Development in the fields of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence has moved up in pace since then. Since then there is a large improvement in how well machines perform complex tasks. Still, despite continuing with these advancements, computers have not been able to match the human mind’s flexibility.

<h3>Types Of Artifical Intelligence?</h3>
<img src={arttimg} alt=""/>
<h6>There are 3 different types of Artificial Intelligence, namely as follows:</h6>
<p>1.Artificial Narrow Intelligence(ANI):This is the most basic type of Artificial Intelligence. These systems are designed to solve one single problem efficiently. They have Narrow Capabilities which means they can excel in a specific task but in a very controlled environment and with limited parameters.</p>
<p>2.Artificial General Intelligence(AGI): This is a theoretical concept of Artificial Intelligence. Its main motive is a machine with a human level of intelligence across a variety of parameters like Language Processing, Image processing, and Computational Abilities. For AGI to function it requires multiple ANI to work together in harmony. Even with the most advanced computational pieces of equipment like Fujitsu’s K and IBM Watson, it took about 40 minutes to mimic one second of the human brain’s neuro-communications. This shows that our computational power is not sufficient and hence AGI is still theoretical in nature.</p>
<p>3.Artificial Super Intelligence(ASI): It is the most advanced theory made for Artificial Intelligence. This theory states that Artificial Intelligence will surpass human thinking capability by constantly adapting and being able to do multiple tasks at once. Since the computational capability has not yet reached the threshold required to mimic human intelligence, AGI is still a theory. Since ASI is an advanced version of AGI, its becoming reality is not evident in the near future</p>
